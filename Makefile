# //////////////////////////////////
#     HOW TO USE THE MAKEFILE
# //////////////////////////////////
# "node" and "tsc" commands need to be downloaded in order for this makefile to work!!
# NOTE : Assume the desired TypeScript file is called test.ts for the following:
#
# Compile TypeScript file (compiled file -> dist folder)
#    make build-test.ts
# Run compiled TypeScript file
#    make run-test.ts
# Compile and Run TypeScript file (file extension isn't needed... make test works)
#    make test.ts
# Remove all compiled TypeScript files (USE CAREFULLY)
#    make clean
# Install all dependencies
#    make install
